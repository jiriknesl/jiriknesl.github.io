      <description>ZettelKasten is a form of personal knowledge base. I will describe it later from my POV, but you can read more here.
The point of ZettelKasten is to have:
 short notes one note describes one topic, they are brief alternatively, card is a hub, index for other cards, a reference, entry point notes link to other cards when they are related you can have permanent notes, you can have notes for given project, or temporary notes to be thrown away in the end of the activity  As I use Notion as my inbox, weekly plan, idea storage, journal, I was thinking how to add even my personal knowledge database.</description>
