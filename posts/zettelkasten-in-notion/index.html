        <h1>Zettelkasten in Notion</h1><time>June 24, 2020</time></header><p>ZettelKasten is a form of personal knowledge base. I will describe it later from my POV, but you can read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">here</a>.</p>
<p>The point of ZettelKasten is to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>short notes</li>
<li>one note describes one topic, they are brief</li>
<li>alternatively, card is a hub, index for other cards, a reference, entry point</li>
<li>notes link to other cards when they are related</li>
<li>you can have permanent notes, you can have notes for given project, or temporary notes to be thrown away in the end of the activity</li>
</ul>
<p>As I use Notion as my inbox, weekly plan, idea storage, journal, I was thinking how to add even my personal knowledge database. So I have built myself an easy implementation.</p>
<p>In my implementation, I use a database within Notion. The whole ZettelKasten is in one table.</p>
<ul>
<li>One card is one topic</li>
<li>I have Hub cards that are entry points</li>
<li>I tag my cards</li>
<li>I link cards and I want backlinks too (when I link between cards, it creates a backlink automatically)</li>
</ul>
<p>My Zettel home looks like this. This is a list of hubs. I have current hubs (links) and I have hubs I plan to create (these are just text notes).</p>

<hr>
<p>Just below hubs, I have a table with my cards. These are very simple.
They have a name, tags, links and backlinks and contents.</p>

<hr>
<p>Within a card (like a Strategy hub here) I can have contents or the contents are empty and the hub is just walkthrough (like learning hub).</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/zettelkasten-in-notion/zettelkasten-strategy-hub.png" alt="Zettelkasten Hub with data">
<img src="/zettelkasten-in-notion/zettelkasten-learning-hub.png" alt="Zettelkasten Hub with links only"></p>
<hr>
<p>Advantages of this is that every single note is easy to link with each other, I get backlinks for free. Also, it is very easy to link to any card Notion-wide.
But there are two disadvantages. First, Notion is not very fast. Working with Obsidian.md, Roam Research, Bear is very fast. So one must sometimes wait for links to show up.
I believe Notion will figure it out over time. I am very commited to using Notion. After years in Day One, years in OneNote, years in Bear, I believe Notion is really Next Big Thing for me.</p>
<p>Second, there&rsquo;s no way I am aware of to really enter new card with a keyboard shortcut into a database within Notion. In this moment, I have a couple of inboxes (I experiment with Drafts app, I have short notes inbox in Notion, long notes inbox in Notion, 2Do inbox, lots of notes to walk through in Bear, OneNote and Day One).</p>
<p>Things I plan to improve in my ZettelKasten workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get used to processing all inboxes not only to tasks and projects notes, but also to ZettelKasten.</li>
<li>Thinking what information would help me that day in my work and building them.</li>
<li>Building &lsquo;cardsets&rsquo; where I will make more cards available easily for me when working (should they be ZettelKasten cards or sections in my weekly plans?)</li>
</ol>
